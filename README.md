# Monosaccharide-Name-Conv
Alternative naming convention for monosaccharides 

# How it works?
This program draws and interprets monosaccharides written in a specific naming convention. To run the program correctly, simply save all 3 files in a single directory, and import draw.py. To draw a sugar with a name sn, simply call drawSugar(sugarname = sn). To draw a specific instance of a Sugar class object, s, call drawSugar(sugar = s). 

You can also import sugars.py file directly, and inside there is a Sugar class, and functions like "interpretSugar(sugar)" and "interpretName(sugarname)" that respectively, create a string variable that represents a name of a sugar instance, or given a name instantiate a sugar. 

Keep in mind! The names are not standard names, but rather they are built accordingly to a custom naming convention
